first of all, you need to have a rubber ducky or a pendrive, if our target's
computer has automatic opening of files on the pendrive, copy everything to the pendrive and it's ready,
but it works when either this option is enabled or our target has Windows 7-XP on Windows 10-11, then it doesn't work because the antivirus blocks it




2.when it comes to browser passwords, you need to have access to the computer for about 15 seconds to enter the application,
select all passwords using CTRL + A and save them on the pendrive using the WIN + S shortcut, the rest will be saved by itself
